# BatExploits
A repo that contains my various .bat file projects and test attempts, as I learn the ins and outs of Windows and the Command Line


Info on each program:

ChromeFork
  This directory contains a bat file and .ico that are used to replace the desktop icon for google chrome. You simply put the bat file somewhere in a directory, right click, add shortcut, rename shortcut to "Google Chrome", and change the image to the ico file. When the victim clicks on the desktop google chrome, it starts a fork bomb, opens the dvd drive, and then the computer runs out of memory and crashes. Simple and Effective. 
  
  CD_DRIVE_PRANK.bat
    This is code that I found online from SuperUser forum user "Bruno". It opens the CD/DVD drive and then closes itself. This program is implemented throughout the other projects in this repository. 
    
ghetto.bat
    This file is a joke "virus" that simply prints out a message to the user telling them about how the program is a "ghetto virus" and tells them to delete the files themselves. I was bored. 
    
gt8prankm8.bat
  This program was supposed to open and then close the cd/dvd drive, but I ran into errors and the closing part of the program is non-functional. 
  
infinite.bat
  A file that recursively calls itself to print out a message. It was the first implementation of a recursively calling fork bomb and cd drive implementation, but was cancelled due to windows automatically cancelling the program after a certain number of recursive steps.
